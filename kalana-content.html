            <h2>Global Challenges to Quality Education and the UN’s Response
            </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Education is one of the key pillars for bringing about sustainable development, 
                but it is still an issue of concern globally. 
                Untold challenges continue to deprive millions of children and adults right to quality education. 
                These are some of the barriers mentioned by the UN as well as working on them through various programs and policies, 
                but the process towards achieving inclusive and equitable education for all is not a short one.

            <h2>The Global Pressures to Quality Education</h2>
            <hr>
            <hr>
            <h3>Poverty and Economic Disparities</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Lack of education is caused by poverty in most cases. 
                These families are unable to pay for fees, uniforms, and materials and lack the basic necessities in life such as food and shelter. 
                Learning becomes scarce among children because they have to work to support their families in most cases. 
                It also means that schools in poor areas are not well endowed with resources and, hence, overcrowded classes, 
                scant learning aids and unevenly trained teachers.
            </p>
            <h3>Conflict and Displacement</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                It reduces access to education through destruction of facilities, 
                creating refugee situations, and making schools unsafe. 
                Many refugee and internally displaced children experience language barriers, 
                lack of passports, and emotional disturbances that hinder them from learning. 
                UNICEF notes that there are 49 million children who are forcibly displaced from their homes because of war and violence,
                 which can undermine their chances at schooling.
            </p>
            <h3>Gender Inequality</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Gender discrimination is still evident, especially in parts of the world where male child education is valued over their female counterparts. 
                Girl child’s experience other problems like early marriage, doing house chores and insecurity while going to school and coming back home. 
                The same source also states that 129 million girls are currently out of school somewhere in the world, 
                a revelation that underscores the need for girls’ education. </p>

            <p>In many developing countries schools and other centers of learning lacks simple amenities like water, hygiene facilities and power supply. 
                The lack of these requirements poses a significant threat to the health and learning ability of students affected. Furthermore, 
                there is a scarcity of quality teachers and many students end up taking lessons from unqualified or low quality teachers.</p>
